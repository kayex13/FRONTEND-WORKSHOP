    <h2 style="text-align: left;">Biography</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Alan Turing was born on June 23, 1912, in London, England. He studied mathematics at King's College, Cambridge, and later joined the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park. Turing's work on breaking the Enigma code helped the Allies win World War II. After the war, he continued his research in computing and artificial intelligence. Turing died on June 7, 1954, at the age of 41.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: left;">Major Achievements</h2>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li>Turing developed the Bombe machine, which helped decrypt German military messages during World War II.</li>
        <li>He introduced the concept of the Turing Machine, a theoretical model that became the basis for modern computers.</li>
        <li>He proposed the Turing Test, a criterion for determining a machineâ€™s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior.</li>
        <li>He pioneered research on morphogenesis, explaining patterns in nature through mathematical equations.</li>
    </ul>
